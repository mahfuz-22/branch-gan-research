# branch-gan-research
This repository contains a modified version of the Branch-GAN codebase, optimized for training and evaluation on IBM Watson Studio. It includes custom data preparation scripts, and evaluation metrics. The code is adapted to work with limited computational resources while maintaining the core functionality of Branch-GAN for text generation.
